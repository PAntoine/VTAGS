VTAGS

by Peter Antoine

Building
--------

If you have gmake install call:
make

Else if you have nmake installed call:
nmake -f makevc

and that's it. 

The docs directory has a man page that needs to be copied into you manpath
and that is it.


Please send any bugs to: vtags@peterantoine.me.uk.

Thanks,

Peter.
